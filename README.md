# Movie Playlists

This is to be a page for handling playlists of your favorite movies and movies that you want to see.

* different types of watch-lists e.g.
  - feelgood 
  - romantic
  - etc.
* Favorites
  - horror
  - sci-fi
  - movies starring joaquin phoenix

Tags could be a good idea. If the movie or actor is in a playlist, it could get a tag from there to be searchable from

Could be good to be able to add a description of why the movie/actor is in the list
* why you want to see it
* Why you like it


You should be able to search for particular actors, directors, years, country of origin, language etc, to be able to find a movie that you're thinking of

Maybe a way to import all the movies from like IMDB to be able to search for the above

Maybe could have a similar design as pinterest
